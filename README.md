# Update!
It now compiles, but does not produce sound. Getting there...

# Assignment3

This, at the moment, is a very sad, non-compiling attempt at assignment 3, creating a MIDI controlled plugin. I'm going to see if I can make it work, though...

The idea is that I'll have a simple plugin with a MidiKeyboardComponent showing the status of the midi keys as they're pressed, with the user able to control gain, distortion, attack, and release of the envelope of the sound, so that they can make these cool percussive, distorted sounds. I'm hoping to implement the actual oscillator in Faust.

Womp womp,

Matt Herrero
