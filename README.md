#Splatter_midi

Splatter_midi is a MIDI synthesizer plugin that uses a chain of Faust-generated simple oscillators with an attack-release envelope applied for each key sound. Also, as each key is pressed, the key color represented on the midi keyboard component will change! If the user has clicked the key with their mouse, the key will change color, and reset to white or black after the key has been released. If the user plays a key using a midi keyboard, the key will stay colored (changing color as each new midi signal is received). The key colors can be reset by clicking on the keys.
